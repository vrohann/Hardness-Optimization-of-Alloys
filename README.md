# Hardness-Optimization-of-Alloys
Analyzed compositional dataset of high entropy alloys for data processing.

Applied several well-known machine learning models i.e. LR, PR, SVR, K-NN to estimate the hardness of alloys.

Employed bootstrapping with replacement for evaluating RMSE to enhance the hardness of alloys by more than 10%
